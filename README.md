# OTTL-GSoC-2026

A standalone proof-of-work implementation for GSoC 2026 that mirrors the structure of OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib's OTTL package. The goal is to validate key pieces of an OTTL stabilization proposal, including for-range grammar support, loop-scope design, nil-safe path traversal, compatibility corpus testing, and draft design documentation.

This repository is not a fork. It is a focused experimental module to show practical, test-backed progress on language and runtime design decisions before upstream integration.

## Brief description of each part

- `go.mod`, `go.sum`: Module definition and dependency lock data.
- `pkg/ottl/grammar.go`: OTTL grammar and lexer definitions, including `parsedForRange` and reserved `for`/`in` keywords.
- `pkg/ottl/ottl.go`: Core transform context with loop-scope design (`loopScope`) and a stubbed `executeForRange` flow.
- `pkg/ottl/nil_safe.go`: `GetNilSafe` helper for safe nested path traversal without panics.
- `pkg/ottl/nil_safe_test.go`: Table-driven and no-panic tests for nil-safe behavior.
- `pkg/ottl/grammar_forrange_test.go`: Standalone participle parser tests validating for-range grammar and compatibility.
- `pkg/ottl/gsoc_benchmarks_test.go`: Benchmark stubs plus one benchmark entry-point skeleton.
- `pkg/ottl/testdata/compat/*.ottl`: Real statement corpus used for backward-compatibility parsing checks.
- `docs/SPEC_DRAFT.md`: Draft language spec (EBNF, execution notes, and type mapping).
- `docs/COOKBOOK_DRAFT.md`: Draft practical patterns and usage examples.
- `docs/MIGRATION_DRAFT.md`: Draft migration guidance and compatibility policy notes.

## Current implementation status

Implemented:

- For-range grammar AST node and lexer keyword reservation.
- Loop-scope context design and variable lookup helper.
- Nil-safe path traversal helper with broad test coverage.
- Grammar tests for for-range parser behavior.
- Compatibility corpus with real OTTL statements.
- Initial benchmark scaffold.
- Draft specification/cookbook/migration documentation.

Not fully implemented yet:

- Runtime execution for for-range evaluator.
- Full parse-time type checker pass.
- Complete benchmark implementations.
- Complete cookbook and spec examples.

## Build and test

```bash
cd OTTL_Project_Implementation
go mod tidy
go build ./...
go test ./...
```

Current status: go build ./... and go test ./... both pass. The getNilSafe computed-key branch is still a known TODO and currently returns an empty value by design.
